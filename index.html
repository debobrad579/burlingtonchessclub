            <p>
              At the Burlington Chess Club, we play CFC-rated tournaments and there is also
              informal, casual play. We do not, however, offer lessons or coaching sessions
              at this time.
              <br>
              We have players as young as 8 and as old as 80, with many in-between.

            <h2 class="subtitle">How the Club is Funded</h2>
            <p>
              There is no membership fee for our club, it’s “pay as you play”.
              <br>
              Each tournament is $25.00 for the entire 5-week tournament and includes the CFC rating fees.
              <br>
              For families, each additional Junior costs $5.00 for the tournament.
              <br>
              Those who prefer casual play are asked to contribute $5.00 per night.

            <p>
              Your first night of casual play is free and you are welcome to come any Tuesday after 7:00 pm.
              <br>
              We can pair you up for a game, or you can simply chat or have a look around.

                  Our tournaments are scheduled for one game per week for five weeks.
                  In order to play in these tournaments, a CFC membership is required:
                </p>
                <ul class="membership-list">
                  <li>CFC Membership - Adult = $48/year</li>
                  <li>CFC Membership - Junior = $32/year</li>

              <div>
                <p>You are required to obey the laws of chess and abide by proper chess etiquette:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>You must keep score of both your moves and your opponent’s moves</li>
                  <li>If you touch a piece, you must move it (if it's legal)</li>
                  <li>If you touch an opponent's piece, you must take it (if it's legal)</li>
                  <li>You must castle with one hand, moving the King first</li>
                  <li>You must make your move and press the clock with the same hand</li>
                  <li>Your move is not complete until your clock has been pressed</li>
                  <li>You must not talk, make noise or disturb your opponent (or anyone else)</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Time control is 60 minutes per player with an increment of 30 seconds from the first move.
                  (i.e. 30 seconds is added to your clock after you complete each move).
                </p>
                <p>We ask that people show up by 7:15, so we can do the pairings and start at 7:30.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Casual Play</h2>
            <p>
              For those who are not ready to join the CFC and play rated tournaments, casual play is now
              available. With casual play, you need not keep score or use a clock.
